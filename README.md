 - index.html (basic html structure)

## Installation

###If you haven't already done so, install grunt-init.  
```
npm install grunt-init -g
```

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your ~/.grunt-init/ directory. 

###Use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:dianitica/grunt-init-sjo.git ~/.grunt-init/sjo
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.
